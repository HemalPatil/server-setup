Aim: Let's encrypt SSL with apache2 on Ubuntu 20.04

Assumptions:
    Domain registered
    Subdomains have required CNAME records created
    Apache virtualhosts configs with correct ServerName and ServerAlias are created
        ServerName = Hostname and port that the server uses to identify itself
        ServerAlias = Alternate names for a host used when matching requests to name-virtual hosts
        Usually ServerName === ServerAlias
